## Description 
Neural Network 

### MNIST
MNIST is dataset of handwritten digits and contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples.

### CNN
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. They are also known as shift invariant or space invariant artificial neural networks, based on the shared-weight architecture of the convolution kernels or filters that slide along input features and provide translation equivariant responses known as feature maps. Counter-intuitively, most convolutional neural networks are only equivariant, as opposed to invariant, to translation. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons.

### KERAS
Keras is an framework of deep learning, and we can use Python to coding. The backend of it always is Tensorflow, CNTK, Theano ...... the most common now is Tensorflow right now.

Most of the mainstream models can be implemented quickly using Keras.
